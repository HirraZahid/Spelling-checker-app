# Spelling-checker-app
The Spelling Checker Software App is a powerful application developed using .NET framework and Visual basic programming language. It provides an interactive platform for users to practice and improve their spelling skills. The software speaks a word, and the user is prompted to write its spelling. If the word is spelled incorrectly, the software provides feedback by saying "wrong," and if it is spelled correctly, it says "right." The app also tracks and displays the number of attempts made and the time taken to answer each word, enhancing the learning experience and encouraging progress.
